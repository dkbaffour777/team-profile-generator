# Team Profile Generator



## Description 

  Team Profile Generator generates a webpage that displays your team's basic info as a manager so that you can have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. Node.js, jest library for tests, inquirer library for command line user interfaces and a custom Javascript functionality that contains a markdown were used to accomplish this task. The program also contains various tests to ensure the application functions as intended.
